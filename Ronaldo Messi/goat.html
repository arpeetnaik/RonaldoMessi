<h1 class = "h1"> &#x1F451; Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi &#x1F451; </h1>
<p>Through their whole career, their willingness to stay humble and work hard is the reason they are who they are.<br>
    From Ronaldo losing his father early in his career, to Messi with his lack of height, neither one of them let anything
    stop them from being the best.<br>
    Award and Accolades are cool, but their knowledge of the game and the ability to carry their teams is what really sets them apart.<br>
    Many still debate on who the best of both is, but in my eyes they should both be respected for what they've done for the game.<br>
    As their careers come to a close soon, there will be something missing from the game that nobody will be able to replicate.<br>
    And for that reason, and that reason only.<br></p>
